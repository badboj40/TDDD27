2. To be decided.
3. Use Django to authenticate log-in to access account features.
4. Use Django database to store user contributed information which will be searchable for other users.

## Frameworks

These are the frameworks we chose to work with during the project.

### React

We chose React because we felt that the framework best suited us with regards to experience using frontend frameworks.

### Django

We chose Django as backend framework because of its easy-to-use nature and removes tedious work so that we can focus on the more important features.

### Heroku

We would like to try and use a deployment service and Heroku, according to our research, would work really well with Django.
